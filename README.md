## About the Project  
This repository is forked from [UI-Ninjas](https://github.com/KhanjarSingh/UI-Ninjas), where I collaborated with two other talented contributors to enhance and refine the original project.  

As a **first-year student**, I created this project using **HTML and CSS** to showcase my learning journey. Even though I am yet to complete my first semester, I am dedicated to making this project more impactful in the future.  

### Key Contributions  
- Built and designed using only **HTML and CSS** as a foundational learning project.  
- Collaborated effectively as part of a team to refine UI/UX designs.  
- Focused on clean, maintainable code to ensure scalability and ease of future development.  

### Looking Ahead  
I plan to enhance this project by adding new features and improving its functionality. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
